# -- Set the following four values to specify exact quantities of license channels to reserve
# Your license must be able to cover the number of channels you specify here
# See MediaServer documentation for more information about channels

# -- Allocate one channel for each concurrent process action that includes audio processing
# Audio channels are used for each of the following processes:
#   Audio categorization
#   Audio matching
#   Language identification
#   Speaker identification
#   Speech-to-text
#   All video management features

#  Text detection
#  All video management features

# -- Allocate one channel for each concurrent process action that includes any visual analytics.
# Visual channels are used for each of the following processes:
#  Ingesting records from another Media Server for further processing
#  All analysis operations except audio processing
#  Face recognition on large databases (maximum 250,000 faces, every additional 250,000 faces requires an additional visual channel)
#  All surveillance and video management features

# -- Allocate one video management channel for each concurrent process action that does not require an audio, surveillance, or visual channel

#   Text segmentation
#  Encoding
