Provides an IDOL OmniGroupServer deployment.

Whilst this can be deployed 'as-is', it is expected that a real deployment will
require configuration particular to the repositories the OGS instance needs to
provide user/group information for.

Consumers of this chart are encouraged to use this as a subchart, providing an
additional config-map with the OGS config file - see `.Values.existingConfigMap`

## Automated OAuth Configuration Generation at Prestart

If `oauthToolConfigMap` is set to a non-empty string, then the OmniGroupServer pod will
attempt to automatically generate any missing OAuth configuration at Prestart.
1. The Prestart script will detect any [External Configuration File Includes](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/idol/IDOL_24_1/OmniGroupServer_24.1_Documentation/Help/Content/Configuration/_ACI_Config_Intro.htm#Include-an-Exter)
   of the "Merge a section of an external configuration file into a specified section with a different name" form,
   where the `SharedSection` is "OAUTH".
2. For each matching external configuration section include in the OmniGroupServer configuration, if the
   required file path (referred to as `ConfigurationFile.cfg` in the linked documentation) is missing,
   an attempt to generate it via `oauth_tool` will be made. `oauth_tool` will be invoked with the
   `oauth_tool.cfg` supplied in the ConfigMap referred to by `oauthToolConfigMap`, and the section name
   specified by `SectionName` in the external configuration section include.

### Constraints
1. The required file path (referred to as `ConfigurationFile.cfg` in the linked documentation) MUST NOT
   be `/omnigroupserver/oauth.cfg`.
2. The oauth_tool workflow MUST NOT require user interaction. Some OAuth providers require user interaction in
   their workflow. For any OAuth configuration where this is the case, the OAuth workflow must be conducted elsewhere
   and the resulting files mounted into the Omnigroupserver container at the expected places for your configuration -
   the presence of the files will prevent automated generation attempts.
